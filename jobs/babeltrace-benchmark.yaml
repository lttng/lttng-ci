      This job is responsible for triggering benchmark jobs in lava and generate the report

      The Babeltrace project provides trace read and write libraries, as well
      as a trace converter. Plugins can be created for any trace format to
      allow its conversion to/from another trace format.

      The main format expected to be converted to/from is the Common Trace
      Format (CTF). The default input format of the "babeltrace" command is
      CTF, and its default output format is a human-readable text log. The
      "babeltrace-log" command converts from a text log to a CTF trace.
